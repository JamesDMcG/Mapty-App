Mapty App

Mapty is an exercise diary app that logs workouts, locations, types, and relevant data. Built with modern JavaScript and Geolocation API integration, it tracks and manages workout data interactively.

Techniques and Features
- Geolocation API: Retrieves user location to map workouts ([MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)).
- Leaflet.js: Displays interactive maps and markers ([Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)).
